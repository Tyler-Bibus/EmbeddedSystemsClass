**** Command Dictionary for the CyBot-GUI communication ****

### ALL COMMANDS END WITH A "d\n" TO SIGNAL THE COMMAND FINISHED ###

Section 1: Movement
Move command: moves forward or backwards cm degrees
	m (signed float cm)
	ex: m 25.0 //this will move 25 cm
	if no bump/hole, return: just "d\n"
	if bump, return : "b (1/2) (float distance remaining)", 1/2 signals left/right, distance remaining is the distance left in cm
	if hole, return : "h (1/2) (float distance remaining)", 1/2 signals left/right, distance remaining is the distance left in cm
	
Turn command: turns left or right deg degrees
	t (signed float deg) //will be converted by cybot to int for turns
	ex: t -30 //this will turn CCW 30 deg
	return: "d\n"
	
	
Section 2: Object Detection
Scan: Full 180 Degree Scan TODO: clean before or after?
	s
	return format for each object:
	(int angle) (float distance cm) (float size cm)
	final return
	"d\n" //This done will tell the GUI when the scan is completed
	example return: "2 20.0 4.3\n" "d\n"
	
Ping (Unused): Pings at 90 degrees
	p 
	return: "(float distance cm)\n"
	
Section 3: Misc

Orchestrate: Sings a song until done or hits max Time
	o (int maxTimeSeconds)
	returns: "d\n"
	
Flush: Flushes out the backed up responses from the cybot
	"f\n"
	return: "f\n" AND THEN "d\n" (both)
	the f allows us to know when we are caught up, then read one more for the d\n
